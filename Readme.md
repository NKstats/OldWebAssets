## Assignment Objectives
For your first submission, you are asked to submit an introductory blog of yourself to present to your fellow DSPG members. Note that these blogs will be hosted on the DSPG 2024 webpage for public viewing so that anyone interested in the program (future participants, clients, recruiters) may also learn about you. The objective is to use these blogs as a way to demonstrate your learning and work progress by documenting your accomplishments throughout the program. 

## What to Include in This Blog
As you prepare your introductions please make sure to include the following information about yourself. Feel free to add any pictures and links you think would make the blogs more presentable. 

- Where are you from?
- What's your current academic year?
- What degrees are you studying? Why did you choose your degrees?
- What are your plans with your degree(s)?
- Why do you care about data science?
- Do you have any prior experience with data science?
- What kinds of extracurricular activities / hobbies do you care about?
- Share an interesting fact/story about yourself. What do you want your peers to know about you?

It's also important that you develop some personal learning objectives for your time in DSPG. The following questions below are designed to help you develop some. After thinking through them, include your answers within the blog so that we can revisit these at the end of the program.

- What skills do you value and appreciate about yourself?
- List some skills in data science that you feel you do well.
- List at least three skills you would like to learn or develop during the DSPG program.
- Why are you pursuing these skills? Why do they matter to you?
- How do you hope to improve these skills?
