    "text": "Introduction & Method\nSentiment analysis is a critical component of natural language processing (NLP) that helps decipher the emotional tone behind words. This analysis is particularly valuable not only in social media monitoring and market research but also in public health initiatives. Understanding public sentiment can significantly enhance health communication strategies, patient engagement, and policy formulation. Moreover, in public health crises, sentiment analysis can help track community reactions to health advisories or public sentiment toward vaccination drives, thus informing more targeted health communication and intervention strategies. However, the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in these sensitive areas is heavily reliant on the quality of preprocessing applied to text data. This post details my approach to preprocessing texts to enhance sentiment analysis. Through a series of carefully designed steps, I aim to transform raw text data into a clean, analyzable format, setting the stage for accurate classification.\n\n\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of the preprocessing techniques I employed to refine the raw tweet data:\n\nURL Removal: I began by stripping URLs from the texts. URLs usually don’t contribute to sentiment and can add irrelevant noise to the text, so removing them helps in focusing on meaningful content.\nTokenization: Next, I tokenized the text by splitting the texts into individual words. This is crucial as it allows us to process the text at the word level, which is essential for the subsequent cleaning and analysis steps.\nRemoving Stopwords: I then removed stopwords - common words such as “the,” “and,” “is,” etc., which are abundant in English but do not carry significant sentiment. Eliminating these words helps reduce textual noise and focuses the analysis on more impactful words that convey sentiment.\nEliminating Special Characters: I also scrubbed the text of special characters like punctuation marks, symbols and emojis. These characters do not typically contribute to sentiment and can impede the performance of sentiment analysis models.\nLemmatization: Finally, I applied lemmatization to consolidate similar words to their base or dictionary forms. Unlike stemming, which simply chops off the ends of words to reach a common base, lemmatization considers the context and morphological analysis of words to accurately transform them to their lemma. This process reduces the number of unique words the model must handle, enhancing its ability to generalize across different variations of the same word.\n\nThrough these text preprocessing steps, I transformed the raw text data into a clean and standardized format. This preparation is vital for conducting accurate sentiment analysis as it helps eliminate noise, reduce the complexity of the data, and focus on the most impactful elements of the text. The preprocessed texts are now ready for further analysis and can be effectively used in sentiment classification models to understand public sentiment."

    "text": "Python Implementation\nBefore creating the preprocessing function, it’s essential to set up the environment with the required packages. This includes loading libraries and downloading necessary data for text manipulation.\n\n# Install the emoji package before loading\n!pip install emoji\n\n\n# Load Required packages\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)\nimport numpy as np\nimport nltk, re, emoji, spacy\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\n# Download necessary NLTK resources\nnltk.download('stopwords')\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\n\n\n\n\nThe preprocess_text function below incorporates all the preprocessing steps discussed in the Introduction & Method section. It is structured to be reusable for any text dataset that requires cleaning for sentiment analysis.\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef preprocess_text(data):\n    processed_data = []\n    # Set of English stopwords\n    stop = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    for sentence in data:\n        # Remove URLs\n        text = re.sub(r'https?://\\S+|www\\.\\S+', '', sentence)\n\n        # Remove emojis using the emoji library\n        text = emoji.replace_emoji(text, replace='')\n\n        # Create spaCy doc object\n        doc = nlp(text)\n\n        lem_list = []\n        for token in doc:\n            if token.is_alpha and token.text.lower() not in stop:  # Check if token is alphabetic and not a stopword\n                if token.pos_ != \"PRON\":  # Exclude all pronouns\n                    lem_list.append(token.lemma_.lower())\n\n        # Rejoin words to form the final cleaned text\n        final_text = ' '.join(lem_list)\n        processed_data.append(final_text)\n\n    return processed_data\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the functionality, the preprocessing function is applied to a sample dataset containing reviews. This will output the cleaned versions of the input reviews, showing how punctuation, common words, and case have been normalized.\n\n# Sample input text\nsample_text = [\"The pandemic has affected the world.. @100% https://example.com!! :)\"]\ncleaned_text = preprocess_text(sample_text)\ncleaned_text\n\n['pandemic affect world']\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, I create a DataFrame with 20 sample reviews, ratings, and IDs, and apply the function to clean the review texts.\n\n# Creating a sample DataFrame with texts\n\ndata = {\n    'Review': [\n        \"Lockdown was necessary for our safety, I fully support it! 😊\",\n        \"I understand the need but it was too long. 😕\",\n        \"Lockdown completely disrupted my life, it was terrible. 😡\",\n        \"It was well-handled and necessary for public health. 🏥\",\n        \"Lockdown helped us control the virus spread. 😷\",\n        \"It was too restrictive and unnecessary for so long. 😒\",\n        \"Not sure if lockdown was the best solution, but we had no choice. 🤷\",\n        \"It saved lives, but at a great personal cost to many. 😔\",\n        \"The government did what was necessary during the lockdown. 👍\",\n        \"Lockdown was too harsh and not managed well. 😠\",\n        \"It was a good measure, but I hated being stuck at home. 🏠😖\",\n        \"Lockdown was essential but mental health suffered a lot. 🧠💔\",\n        \"The benefits outweigh the negatives of the lockdown. ➕➖\",\n        \"Poor execution made it harder than it should be. 😞\",\n        \"Lockdown was over before it was truly safe to do so. 😨\",\n        \"We needed the lockdown to protect vulnerable populations. 🛡️\",\n        \"The economic impact of lockdown was devastating. 💸\",\n        \"Lockdown showed we can take collective action when needed. 🤝\",\n        \"It was necessary, but the government support was insufficient. 💔\",\n        \"Lockdown should have been stricter to be more effective. ⚠️\"\n    ],\n    'Sentiment_Rating': [5, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 2, 4]\n}\n\n# Creating the DataFrame\nreviews_df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Applying the text preprocessing function\nreviews_df['Cleaned_Review'] = preprocess_text(reviews_df['Review'].tolist())\nreviews_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview\nSentiment_Rating\nCleaned_Review\n\n\n\n\n0\nLockdown was necessary for our safety, I fully support it! 😊\n5\nlockdown necessary safety fully support\n\n\n1\nI understand the need but it was too long. 😕\n3\nunderstand need long\n\n\n2\nLockdown completely disrupted my life, it was terrible. 😡\n1\nlockdown completely disrupt life terrible\n\n\n3\nIt was well-handled and necessary for public health. 🏥\n4\nwell handle necessary public health\n\n\n4\nLockdown helped us control the virus spread. 😷\n5\nlockdown help control virus spread\n\n\n5\nIt was too restrictive and unnecessary for so long. 😒\n2\nrestrictive unnecessary long\n\n\n6\nNot sure if lockdown was the best solution, but we had no choice. 🤷\n3\nsure lockdown good solution choice\n\n\n7\nIt saved lives, but at a great personal cost to many. 😔\n3\nsave life great personal cost many\n\n\n8\nThe government did what was necessary during the lockdown. 👍\n4\ngovernment necessary lockdown\n\n\n9\nLockdown was too harsh and not managed well. 😠\n1\nlockdown harsh manage well\n\n\n10\nIt was a good measure, but I hated being stuck at home. 🏠😖\n3\ngood measure hate stick home\n\n\n11\nLockdown was essential but mental health suffered a lot. 🧠💔\n2\nlockdown essential mental health suffer lot\n\n\n12\nThe benefits outweigh the negatives of the lockdown. ➕➖\n4\nbenefit outweigh negative lockdown\n\n\n13\nPoor execution made it harder than it should be. 😞\n2\npoor execution make hard\n\n\n14\nLockdown was over before it was truly safe to do so. 😨\n3\nlockdown truly safe\n\n\n15\nWe needed the lockdown to protect vulnerable populations. 🛡️\n5\nneed lockdown protect vulnerable population\n\n\n16\nThe economic impact of lockdown was devastating. 💸\n1\neconomic impact lockdown devastating\n\n\n17\nLockdown showed we can take collective action when needed. 🤝\n4\nlockdown show take collective action need\n\n\n18\nIt was necessary, but the government support was insufficient. 💔\n2\nnecessary government support insufficient\n\n\n19\nLockdown should have been stricter to be more effective. ⚠️\n4\nlockdown strict effective"
