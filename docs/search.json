I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at Iowa State University.\nI am dedicated to developing statistical methods and tools that address public health challenges. My goal is to master methodologies that can identify the most effective treatments and interventions by analyzing data from observational studies, clinical trials and other sources. I am particularly interested in statistical frameworks that differentiate between correlations and causality, and in applying causal approaches to personalize treatments for individuals within a diverse population, acknowledging the heterogeneity inherent in health datasets. Additionaly, I am interested in looking into the dynamics of infectious disease transmission by developing mathematical and statistical models to simulate the spread of diseases and assess the potential impact of strategies like vaccination, quarantine, social distancing, etc., to control disease spread.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\n\n    \n        Causal Inference\n     \n    \n        Precision Medicine\n    \n    \n        Infectious Disease Modeling\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n    \n        PhD (Student) in Applied Mathematics\n        Iowa State University, Ames, 2023 - 2024\n     \n    \n        MS in Applied Statistics & Data Science\n        University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), Edinburg, 2023\n    \n    \n        BS in Mathematics\n        University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Ghana, 2020\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience\n\n\n    \n        Graduate Research Assistant, ..........

    "text": "Outline\n\nIntroduction\nPython Implementation\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn sentiment analysis, the quality of input data can significantly influence the accuracy and effectiveness of the final outcomes. Analyzing texts, given their concise nature and informal language, presents unique challenges. This blog post details my approach to preprocessing texts to enhance sentiment analysis. Through a series of carefully designed steps, I aim to transform raw text data into a clean, analyzable format, setting the stage for accurate classification.\n\n\n\nFirst, I removed any URLs from the tweets since they do not contribute to sentiment analysis and only add noise and irrelevant information to the text.\nNext, I tokenized the tweets by splitting them into individual words. Tokenization allows for processing the text at a detailed level, treating each word as a separate entity, which is crucial for the cleaning and analysis that follows.\nAfter tokenization, I applied text cleaning steps to refine the data further. This included removing stopwords—common words like “the,” “and,” “is,” which do not carry significant sentiment information. Eliminating these words helps reduce textual noise and focuses the analysis on more impactful words that convey sentiment.\nI also removed special characters, such as punctuation marks and symbols, from the text. These characters do not aid in sentiment analysis and can hinder the performance of further analyses.\nAdditionally, I performed lemmatization on the text, which reduces words to their base or root forms. This consolidates similar words and reduces dimensionality, improving the model’s ability to generalize across different variations of words. For instance, words like “running,” “ran,” and “runs” are all reduced to the base form “run.”\nBy applying these text preprocessing techniques, I transformed the raw tweet data into a clean and standardized format. This preparation is crucial for accurate sentiment analysis as it helps to eliminate noise, reduce dimensionality, and concentrate on the most relevant text features. The preprocessed tweets are now ready for further analysis and sentiment classification using suitable models.\n\n\nPython codes implementation\nBefore creating the preprocessing function, it’s essential to set up the environment with the required packages. This includes loading libraries and downloading necessary data for text manipulation.\n\n# Load Required packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport nltk, re\nfrom nltk import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport emoji\n\n# Download necessary NLTK resources\nnltk.download('stopwords')\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\n\n[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/solomoneshun/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/solomoneshun/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/solomoneshun/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nnltk: A toolkit for natural language processing that provides capabilities for tokenizing, stemming, and more.\nre: Helps in removing punctuation and non-alphabetical characters using regular expressions.\nstopwords: Common words in English that do not add much meaning to sentences and are often removed in the preprocessing step (eg. is, the, a, and, an, …).\n\n\n\nDefining the Text Preprocessing Function\nThe main function, preprocess_text, cleans up the text data by removing unwanted characters, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing the words.\n\ndef preprocess_text(data):\n  \n    processed_data = []\n    stop = set(stopwords.words('english'))  # Set of English stopwords\n\n    for k in range(len(data)):\n\n        # Remove URLs\n        text = re.sub(r'https?://\\S+|www\\.\\S+', '', data[k])\n\n        # Remove emojis using the emoji library\n        text = emoji.replace_emoji(text, replace='')\n\n        # Remove non-alphabet characters and convert to lowercase\n        text = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text).lower().split()\n\n        # Lemmatize words and remove stopwords\n        lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n        stem_list = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(i) for i in text if i not in stop]\n\n        # Rejoin words to form the final cleaned text\n        final_text = ' '.join(stem_list)\n        processed_data.append(final_text)\n\n    return processed_data\n\n\n\nSteps Explained:\n\nRegular Expression: re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', data[k]) removes any character that is not a letter.\nLowercasing & Splitting: Converts the text to lowercase and splits into individual words.\nLemmatization: Reduces words to their base or root form.\nStopwords Removal: Filters out common words that are unlikely to contribute to sentiment analysis.\n\nTo demonstrate the functionality, the preprocessing function is applied to a sample dataset containing reviews. This will output the cleaned versions of the input reviews, showing how punctuation, common words, and case have been normalized.\n\n# Sample input text\nsample_text = [\"This place is amazing 😊👍 .. @ 100% Check: https://example.com!! :)\"]\ncleaned_text = preprocess_text(sample_text)\nprint(cleaned_text)\n\n['place amazing check']\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Larger DataFrame and Cleaning Texts\nNext, we create a larger DataFrame with 20 sample reviews, ratings, and IDs, and apply the function to clean the review texts.\n\n# Generating sample data\ndata = {\n    'Review': [\n        \"Love this place, will come again!👍\", \"Not coming again! very bad experience!😡\",\n        \"Best experience ever, highly recommend!\", \"Worst place I have been to!\",\n        \"Just okay, nothing special.🙂\", \"Fantastic service and food!\",\n        \"Would not recommend this place to anyone.\", \"Great location, mediocre food.\",\n        \"Terrible customer service.\", \"Amazing atmosphere, will return!\",\n        \"Overpriced for the quality.\", \"Perfect spot for a weekend getaway!\",\n        \"Dirty rooms and rude staff.\", \"Exceptional service and amenities!\",\n        \"Too noisy and crowded.\", \"Peaceful and relaxing environment.\",\n        \"Unfriendly staff and bad food.\", \"Loved the outdoor setting!\",\n        \"Cancellation policy is too strict.\", \"Excellent choice for families!\"\n    ],\n    'Rating': [5, 1, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 5]\n}\n\n# Creating the DataFrame\nreviews_df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Applying the text preprocessing function\nreviews_df['Cleaned_Review'] = preprocess_text(reviews_df['Review'].tolist())\nreviews_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview\nRating\nCleaned_Review\n\n\n\n\n0\nLove this place, will come again!👍\n5\nlove place come\n\n\n1\nNot coming again! very bad experience!😡\n1\ncoming bad experience\n\n\n2\nBest experience ever, highly recommend!\n5\nbest experience ever highly recommend\n\n\n3\nWorst place I have been to!\n1\nworst place\n\n\n4\nJust okay, nothing special.🙂\n3\nokay nothing special\n\n\n5\nFantastic service and food!\n5\nfantastic service food\n\n\n6\nWould not recommend this place to anyone.\n1\nwould recommend place anyone\n\n\n7\nGreat location, mediocre food.\n3\ngreat location mediocre food\n\n\n8\nTerrible customer service.\n1\nterrible customer service\n\n\n9\nAmazing atmosphere, will return!\n5\namazing atmosphere return\n\n\n10\nOverpriced for the quality.\n2\noverpriced quality\n\n\n11\nPerfect spot for a weekend getaway!\n5\nperfect spot weekend getaway\n\n\n12\nDirty rooms and rude staff.\n1\ndirty room rude staff\n\n\n13\nExceptional service and amenities!\n5\nexceptional service amenity\n\n\n14\nToo noisy and crowded.\n2\nnoisy crowded\n\n\n15\nPeaceful and relaxing environment.\n4\npeaceful relaxing environment\n\n\n16\nUnfriendly staff and bad food.\n1\nunfriendly staff bad food\n\n\n17\nLoved the outdoor setting!\n4\nloved outdoor setting\n\n\n18\nCancellation policy is too strict.\n2\ncancellation policy strict\n\n\n19\nExcellent choice for families!\n5\nexcellent choice family"
