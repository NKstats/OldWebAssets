Feel free to add any pictures and links you think would make the blogs more presentable.\n\nWhere are you from?\nWhat’s your current academic year?\nWhat degrees are you studying? Why did you choose your degrees?\nWhat are your plans with your degree(s)?\nWhy do you care about data science?\nDo you have any prior experience with data science?\nWhat kinds of extracurricular activities / hobbies do you care about?\nShare an interesting fact/story about yourself. What do you want your peers to know about you?\n\nIt’s also important that you develop some personal learning objectives for your time in DSPG. The following questions below are designed to help you develop some. After thinking through them, include your answers within the blog so that we can revisit these at the end of the program.\n\nWhat skills do you value and appreciate about yourself?\nList some skills in data science that you feel you do well.\nList at least three skills you would like to learn or develop during the DSPG program.\nWhy are you pursuing these skills? Why do they matter to you?\nHow do you hope to improve these skills?"
